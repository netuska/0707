In this chapter, an agent is defined as an entity that interacts with its environment through sensors and actuators. The behavior of the agent is described by the agent function, a mathematical mapping from percept sequences to actions. To illustrate this, the authors introduce the vacuum-cleaner world, a simple environment consisting of two squares (A and B). The agent can perceive whether its current location is dirty and can choose actions accordingly, such as moving left or right, sucking up dirt, or doing nothing. This basic example helps explain how agents operate and how their behavior can be systematically defined.
