In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in Agentic AI. While the concept itself is not entirely new, the recent spike in advancements in AI and machine learning has reignited public and academic curiosity. What was once a niche topic has now become a central point of discussion, as more people recognize its potential and implications.

In a paper that appeared in 1991, Brustoloni defined an autonomous agent as a system capable of autonomous, purposeful action in the real world. These agents must be able to sense, act, and pursue goals without requiring constant external control.
He identified three categories of agents:
The first is regulation agents, which react directly to sensor input—for example, thermostats.
The second category is planning agents, where AI is used to create plans and choose actions.
The third type is adaptive agents, which learn from experience and improve their performance over time.
He also outlined key requirements for building autonomous agents, such as modular architecture, real-time responsiveness, learning mechanisms, and continuous sensing and acting.

In another paper that appeared in 1996, Stan Franklin and Art Graesser defined an agent as "a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to affect what it senses in the future."
This definition aims to distinguish agents from regular programs through key characteristics such as autonomy, persistence, and goal-directed behavior.

    Autonomy means the agent operates on its own, without needing constant instructions from a human or another program. It can make decisions and take actions independently.

    Persistence means the agent continues to run over time. It doesn’t just perform a single task and stop; instead, it stays active, monitoring and responding to its environment as needed.

    Goal-directed behavior means the agent acts with a purpose. It doesn’t just react randomly; it tries to achieve specific objectives that were either built into it or learned over time.
